2 things need updated with information from the OAuth service provider:
 * config.inc.php
 * the URL's of the providers resources (to get tokens, manipulate user info, etc.)

There are several directories here which relate to OAuth service providers
and their interfaces. The current directory contains generic examples.

Please contribute to example code for new providers as they come along accordingly.

The example code writes token information to /tmp in a static file, this is not
a good idea for anything beyond tinkering, you should store these tokens
somewhere safer.
